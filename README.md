# Review App

## Project Overview

### Description
- Review App created with React
- You can search for articles, log in and post comments
- First time working with Firebase
- In order to avoid to many database queries I kept the logic for rendering the locations inside the folder and only outsourced the comments to firebase
- First time working with React Router v5
- **Disabled Firebase connection**
